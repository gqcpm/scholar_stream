I need to solve the equation √(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7, and find all positive values of x. Hmm, radicals can be tricky, but maybe if I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. Let me try that.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7.\\n\\nOkay, so the idea is to isolate one of the radicals and then square both sides. Let me try moving the second radical to the other side:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) = 7 + √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, if I square both sides, maybe I can get rid of the square roots. Let's do that:\\n\\n(√(x² + 165))² = (7 + √(x² - 52))².\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))².\\n\\nThe right side is expanded using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So the right side becomes 7² + 2*7*√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))², which is 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (x² - 52).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + x² - 52.\\n\\nHmm, let's simplify the right side. The x² terms will cancel out, right? Let's subtract x² from both sides:\\n\\n165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) - 52.\\n\\nSimplify the constants on the right:\\n\\n49 - 52 is -3, so:\\n\\n165 = -3 + 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the radical term:\\n\\n165 + 3 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nSo 168 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nDivide both sides by 14:\\n\\n168 / 14 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\n12 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n\\n12² = x² - 52.\\n\\n144 = x² - 52.\\n\\nAdd 52 to both sides:\\n\\n144 + 52 = x².\\n\\n196 = x².\\n\\nSo x = √196 = 14.\\n\\nBut wait, since the problem states that x is positive, we only take the positive root. So x = 14.\\n\\nBut hold on, when dealing with squaring equations, sometimes extraneous solutions can come up. I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation.\\n\\nLet's plug x = 14 back into the original equation:\\n\\n√(14² + 165) - √(14² - 52) = ?\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n14² is 196.\\n\\nSo first radical: √(196 + 165) = √361 = 19.\\n\\nSecond radical: √(196 - 52) = √144 = 12.\\n\\nSo 19 - 12 = 7, which is exactly the right-hand side. So yes, it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 14. Since the problem says x is positive, we don't have to consider negative roots. So I think that's the answer.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the equation \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\\\) for positive \\\\(x\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the given equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Isolate one of the square roots by moving \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\\\) to the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} = 7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165})^2 = (7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52})^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} + (x^2 - 52)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Combine like terms on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 52 + 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Subtract \\\\(x^2\\\\) from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   165 = -3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   168 = 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Divide both sides by 14:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12 = \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12^2 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying:\\n   \\\\[\\n   144 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n9. Add 52 to both sides to solve for \\\\(x^2\\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   196 = x^2\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n10. Take the positive square root (since \\\\(x\\\\) is positive):\\n    \\\\[\\n    x = \\\\sqrt{196} = 14\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n11. Verify the solution by substituting \\\\(x = 14\\\\) back into the original equation:\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\sqrt{14^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{14^2 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{196 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{196 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{361} - \\\\sqrt{144} = 19 - 12 = 7\\n    \\\\]\\n    The solution checks out.\\n\\nThus, the only positive solution is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{14}\\n\\\\]<|im_end|>\\n\""

Additionally, describe the concept of operator precedence and provide examples of how it affects the evaluation of boolean expressions. Discuss the difference between short-circuit evaluation and normal evaluation in boolean expressions and demonstrate their usage in code. \\n\\nFurthermore, add the requirement that the code must be written in a language that does not support short-circuit evaluation natively, forcing the test taker to implement their own logic for short-circuit evaluation.\\n\\nFinally, delve into the concept of truthiness and falsiness in programming languages, explaining how it affects the evaluation of boolean expressions. Add the constraint that the test taker must write code that handles cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across different programming languages.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nBoolean operators are logical operators used in programming to manipulate boolean values. They operate on one or more boolean operands and return a boolean result. The three main boolean operators are \"AND\" (&&), \"OR\" (||), and \"NOT\" (!).\\n\\nThe \"AND\" operator returns true if both of its operands are true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) and (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"OR\" operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) or (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"NOT\" operator negates the boolean value of its operand. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = not (x > 10)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nOperator precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. It ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly. In most programming languages, logical AND has higher precedence than logical OR. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = True or False and False  # This expression is evaluated as (True or (False and False)), which is True\\n```\\n\\nShort-circuit evaluation is a behavior where the second operand of a logical operator is not evaluated if the result can be determined based on the value of the first operand. In short-circuit evaluation, if the first operand of an \"AND\" operator is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be false. Similarly, if the first operand of an \"OR\" operator is true, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be true.\\n\\nIn programming languages that support short-circuit evaluation natively, you can use it to improve performance or avoid errors. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nif x != 0 and (y / x) > 10:\\n    # Perform some operation\\n```\\n\\nIn languages without native short-circuit evaluation, you can implement your own logic to achieve the same behavior. Here\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\n\\n```\\nif x != 0 {\\n    if (y / x) > 10 {\\n        // Perform some operation\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTruthiness and falsiness refer to how non-boolean values are evaluated in boolean contexts. In many programming languages, non-zero numbers and non-empty strings are considered truthy, while zero, empty strings, and null/None values are considered falsy.\\n\\nWhen evaluating boolean expressions, truthiness and falsiness come into play. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = x  # The value of x is truthy, so result is also truthy\\n```\\n\\nTo handle cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across programming languages, you can explicitly check the desired condition. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = bool(x)  # Explicitly converting x to a boolean value\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that the result is always a boolean value, regardless of the language\\'s truthiness and falsiness rules.<|im_end|>\\n'"

            "Okay, so I need to solve the equation (x + 2)^2 = 0. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have something squared equals zero, the solution is usually the value that makes the inside zero. Let me think. If I have (something)^2 = 0, then that something must be zero because any real number squared is non-negative, and the only way it can be zero is if the number itself is zero. So applying that here, (x + 2)^2 = 0 means that x + 2 must be zero. So, solving for x, I subtract 2 from both sides. That would give me x = -2. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If x is -2, then plugging back into the original equation: (-2 + 2)^2 = 0^2 = 0. Yeah, that works. But wait, since it's a square, does this equation have only one solution or two? I think in real numbers, squaring a number gives zero only when the number itself is zero. So even though the equation is a quadratic, the solution is a repeated root. So x = -2 is the only solution, but with multiplicity two. But the question just says \"solve,\" so maybe they just want the value of x, which is -2. Let me confirm. If I expand (x + 2)^2, it's x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 - 16)] / 2 = [-4 ± 0]/2 = -4/2 = -2. So yes, the quadratic formula confirms that there's only one solution, x = -2. So the answer is x = -2. I think that's it. No other solutions because the discriminant is zero, so it's a repeated root. Alright, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n",
