            "The SWE agents realm has seen significant advancements as of today (Jan 21, 2026), with the introduction of SWE-Gym and SWE-rebench. SWE-Gym is the first environment for training real-world software engineering (SWE) agents, containing 2,438 real-world Python task instances. This environment has enabled training of language model based SWE agents, achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on the popular SWE-Bench Verified and Lite test sets. Additionally, SWE-rebench has been introduced as an automated pipeline for task collection and decontaminated evaluation of SWE agents. This pipeline addresses the critical challenges of scarce high-quality training data and the need for real-world SWE scenario data.\n"
